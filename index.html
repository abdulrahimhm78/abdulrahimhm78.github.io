# Abdul Rahim Hakim Mohammed  
**Senior SAFe Scrum Master | Agile Delivery Lead | Enterprise Agile Delivery**

Fortune 500 Agile Delivery Leader specializing in **predictable execution, flow-based delivery, dependency recovery, and executive visibility** across large-scale, regulated, and data-intensive environments.

## Executive Positioning (Inbound-Focused)

This GitHub profile is designed to support **recruiter search and executive evaluation**, not open-source signaling.

I operate in environments where:
- PI plans exist but execution fails
- Dependencies derail commitments
- Velocity looks good while outcomes don’t
- Leadership lacks decision-ready delivery signals

My work focuses on **stabilizing delivery systems**, not running ceremonies.

## LinkedIn Power Content (Inbound Authority Engine)

This mirrors how I build **Know-Like-Trust** and algorithmic reach on LinkedIn.

**Authority Signal**
> Most delivery failures aren’t execution problems.  
> They’re visibility failures.

**Credibility Signal**
> Velocity doesn’t predict outcomes.  
> Flow does.

**Recruiter Magnet**
> Applying to jobs loses to being found by search.

Content follows:
**Hook → Rehook → Value → CTA**  
Designed to drive inbound recruiter engagement without high posting volume.
