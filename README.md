## Professional Summary
Senior Scrum Master and Agile Delivery Lead with experience supporting large-scale platform, cloud, and data initiatives in regulated enterprise environments. Works closely with Product, Engineering, and leadership teams to bring structure and clarity to delivery when priorities shift, dependencies surface late, or planning assumptions become unrealistic.

Focus is on practical execution — helping teams plan with realistic capacity, improve backlog readiness, and make delivery risks visible early. This approach has consistently improved sprint and PI predictability, reduced spillover, and strengthened confidence in delivery commitments across multi-team programs.

This profile and portfolio reflect hands-on Scrum leadership based on real delivery environments rather than theory or ceremony-only facilitation.
