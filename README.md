# Abdul Rahim Hakim Mohammed
## Senior Scrum Master · Agile Delivery Leader · RTE-Level Execution Partner

I work at the intersection of **team-level execution and program-level alignment**, helping organizations move from activity-driven delivery to **predictable, outcome-driven execution**.  

My primary focus is **Senior Scrum Master leadership**, with practical experience operating at **Release Train Engineer (RTE) altitude** — facilitating cross-team coordination, PI planning, dependency management, and delivery governance when scale demands it.

---

## Where I Add Immediate Value
I am typically engaged when:
- PI commitments are repeatedly missed despite capable teams
- Dependencies surface mid-sprint instead of pre-commitment
- Backlogs are full but not truly ready
- Velocity is reported, but predictability is absent
- Leadership lacks a clear signal of delivery health

My role is not to increase ceremony — it is to **restore execution discipline and delivery confidence.**

---

## Delivery Outcomes
- **30%+ improvement** in Sprint and PI Predictability  
- **~25% reduction** in Spillover and Rework  
- Coordinated **6–12 concurrent squads** across shared services  
- Strengthened cross-team sequencing and integration readiness  
- Shifted organizations from **velocity reporting to flow-based outcomes**

---

## How I Operate as a Senior Scrum Master
- Treat **capacity and dependencies as constraints**, not afterthoughts  
- Enforce **Definition of Ready and Definition of Done** as delivery controls  
- Use **Flow Metrics** — Cycle Time, Throughput, WIP — to expose bottlenecks early  
- Balance **team empowerment with accountability**  
- Protect sustainable pace while improving commitment reliability  
- Maintain delivery transparency through visible dashboards and signals  
- Coach teams toward vertical slicing, not horizontal tasking

---

## When Operating at RTE / Program Level
- Facilitate **PI Planning preparation and alignment**  
- Surface cross-team dependencies before commitments are locked  
- Support Inspect & Adapt events with data-backed insights  
- Maintain program-level delivery visibility without micromanaging teams  
- Align sequencing decisions with business priorities and architectural runway  
- Act as a stabilizing bridge between teams, Product, Architecture, and Leadership

> Effective delivery is not achieved by adding more process.  
> It is achieved by correcting the few execution decisions that break predictability at scale — and making reliable delivery the norm.
